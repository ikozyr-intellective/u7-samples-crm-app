# Unity 7 Customization Tutorial
## Overview
We are going to create an application supporting corporate customer relationship activities.
It should let users:

* Create and search objects representing Customers using fields such as State, City and Telephone number;
* For each Customer users should view and add Correspondence documents;
* Values for the State and City fields should be taken from the actual US dictionary;
* When searching using Telephone number application should validate the area code relying on the State and City selected (use the actual area code dictionary as well).
